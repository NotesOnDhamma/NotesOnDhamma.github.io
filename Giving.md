# Motivation for Giving

| Motivation | Thought |
| -- | -- |
| For the sake of rebirth | I'll enjoy this after death |
| On accounts of ethics | Giving is good |
| Sake of tradition | It would not be right for me to let this old family custom die! |
| Out  of compassion | I cook, but they (being recluses) do not cook [do not keep house] |
| For the sake of one's religion | Just as there were the great sacrifices of the sages of the past ... in the same way, I will distribute my gifts |
| For the sake off metal calm | When this gift of mine is given, it calms my mind. Satisfaction and joy arise |
| The best way to give | This is an adornment for the mind, a support for the mind |
