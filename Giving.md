# Motivation for Giving

| Motivation | Thought | Result |
| -- | -- | -- |
| For the sake of rebirth | I'll enjoy this after death | Born in the host of 4 Kings, but return to the world |
| On accounts of ethics | Giving is good | Born in the host of the devas of the Thirty-three, but return to the world | 
| Sake of tradition | It would not be right for me to let this old family custom die! | in the company of the devas of Yama, but return to the world |
| Out  of compassion | I cook, but they (being recluses) do not cook [do not keep house] | Born in the company of the Tusita devas, but return to the world |
| For the sake of one's religion | Just as there were the great sacrifices of the sages of the past ... in the same way, I will distribute my gifts | Born in the company of the Nimmanaratī devas [who delight in creation], but return to the world |
| For the sake off metal calm | When this gift of mine is given, it calms my mind. Satisfaction and joy arise | Born in the company of the Para,nimmita,vasavattī devas [who lord over the creations of others], but return to the world |
| The best way to give | This is an adornment for the mind, a support for the mind| Born in the company of Brahma’s Retinue, and exhausting this Kamma becomes a non returner |
